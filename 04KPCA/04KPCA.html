# Outline

- Feature mapping
--

  + Why we sometimes need to go to higher dimensions to get to lower dimensions.
--

- Kernel trick
--

  + How we can compute inner products of high (even infinite) dimensional transformations of the data using only our original data
--

- Kernel PCA algorithm
--

  + Using this for PCA.

# Feature Mapping

---

# Non linear PCA

- Regular PCA gives principal components that are linear functions of the data.
--

- As a rough idea consider including polynomials `\(x^2, x^3,x^4,\dots\)` as well as cross products.
--

- In general, let `\(\Phi:\bbR^p\rightarrow\bbR^P\)` where `\(P&gt;p\)` be a feature map.
--

- Rather than carry out principal components on `\(\bx\)`, carry out principal components on `\(\Phi(\bx)\)`

---

# Question

- Aren't we doing dimension reduction?
--

- Yes, however the idea is that a linear algorithm (like PCA) can only reveal patterns if we transform to a higher dimension first.
--

- Consider this example

---

# Circles

&lt;img src="04KPCA_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Circles example

- Suppose we use PCA to go from 2 dimensions to 1 dimension.
--

- Since PCA can only rotate the data, there is no way to separate out the black and yellow points.
--

- This may be an important feature that we want to identify in lower dimensional space.

---

# First PC of circles example


&lt;img src="04KPCA_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Add dimension

- Consider adding a new variable given by `\(x_3=x_1^2+x_2^2\)`
--

- Then we we carry out PCA on `\(x_1\)`, `\(x_2\)` and `\(x_3\)`
--

- Will the first principal component separate out the black and yellow points.

# Problems

- How to compute feature space?
--

- Will this be computationally feasible?
--

- There is a trick we can use so that we never have to compute the feature space
--

- This is known as the 'kernel' trick and is pervasive in machine learning.

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# The kernel trick

---

# The kernel trick

- Consider `\(\Phi(\bx)\)` which is an `\(P\)` dimensional vector.
--

- In many algorithms (including PCA) the solution can be reworked in terms of `\(\langle\Phi(\bx),\Phi(\bz)\rangle\)` (or if you prefer `\(\Phi(\bx)'\Phi(\bz)\)`).
--

- The inner product in the feature space, can be written as a function of `\(\bx\)` and `\(\bz\)`, known as the kernel
`$$\langle\Phi(\bx),\Phi(\bz)\rangle=K(\bx,\bz)$$`


---

# An example

- Consider the mapping `\(\Phi(\bx)=\left(x_1^2,\dots,x_p^2,\right.\)`--
`\(\sqrt{2}x_1x_2,\dots,\sqrt{2}x_{p-1}x_p,\)`--
`\(\sqrt{2}x_1,\dots,\sqrt{2}x_p,\)`--
`\(\left.1\right)\)`
--

- We have gone from an `\(p\)`-dimensional vector to a `\(P=(p(p+3))/2)+1\)` dimensional vector.
--

- The kernel function is

`$$K(\bx,\bz)=(\langle\bx,\bz\rangle+1)^2=\langle\Phi(\bx),\Phi(\bz)\rangle$$`
--

- This is called a polynomial kernel.

---

# Other kernels

- Other kernels are available
--

  + RBF kernel
  + Hyperbolic tangent kernel
--

- These may provide the inner product for infinite dimensional feature spaces.
--

- The feature space may not be unique.

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Kernel PCA

---

# A PCA refresher

- The standard way to do PCA is to solve the eigenvalue problem
--

`$$\bS\bv=\lambda\bv$$`
--

- This is equivalent to
--

`$$\frac{1}{n-1}\bX'\bX\bv=\lambda\bv$$`
- The principal components are given by `\(\bX\bv\)` (not by `\(\bv\)`).

---

# A silly way to do PCA

- Take
--

`$$\frac{1}{n-1}\bX'\bX\bv=\lambda\bv$$`
--

- Pre-multiply by `\(\bX\)` and rearrange
--

`$$\bX\bX'\bX\bv=(n-1)\lambda\bX\bv$$`
- Replace `\(\bX\bv\)` with `\(\by\)` and `\((n-1)\lambda\)` with `\(\tilde{\lambda}\)`
--

`$$\bX\bX'\by=\tilde{\lambda}\by$$`

---

# Kernel matrix

-  Principal components could be found by finding eigenvectors of `\(\bX\bX'\)` instead of `\(\frac{1}{n}\bX'\bX\)`.
--

- Normally you wouldn't do this since `\(\bX\bX'\)` will be a bigger matrix than `\(\bX'\bX\)`
--

- Unless...
--
rather than `\(\bX\)` with rows `\(\bx_i\)` you have a matrix with rows `\(\Phi(\bx_i)\)`.
--

 + Then `\(\bX\bX'\)` becomes `\(\bK\)`.
--

 + Here `\(\bK\)` is the **kernel matrix** an `\(n\times n\)` matrix with elements `\(K(\bx_i,\bx_j)\)`.
 
---

# Some caveats

- That is a simpler treatment than what you will find in many references.
--

- A more formal treatment has to deal more carefully with the possible infinite dimensionality of the feature space.
--

- Care must be taken to center `\(\bK\)` by pre and post multiplying by the centering matrix `\(\bI-n^{-1}\iota\iota'\)`  
--

- Some sources will rescale the eigenvectors of `\(\bK\)` by `\(n-1\)` or `\(\lambda\)`.

---

# Demonstration

- Recall the world bank data.
--

- This data was analysed using PCA.
--

- On the following slide, the PCA output will be shown again
--

- After that we will work through applying kernel PCA to the same dataset.

---

# Standard PCA


&lt;img src="04KPCA_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# The dimRed package

- The [`dimRed` package](https://github.com/gdkrmr/dimRed) provides a unified framework for many dimension reduction techniques.
--

- It uses an S4 class for handling data with two slots
--

  + The slot `data` contains data (measures of development)
  + The slot `meta` contains other information (country names)

---

# Kernel PCA in dimRed

- By default dimRed uses the radial basis kernel
--

`$$K(\bx,\bz)=\exp\left(-\frac{||\bx-\bz||^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$`
--

- The default value of the tuning parameter is `\(\sigma=0.1\)`

---

# Code


```r
library(tidyverse)
library(dimRed)
read_csv('../data/WorldBankClean.csv')%&gt;% #Read Data
  mutate_if(is.numeric,scale)%&gt;% #Scale Data
  as.dimRedData(`Country Name` + `Country Code`~.,data=.)-&gt;wb #Convert to S4 class
  
kpcaout &lt;- embed(.data = wb, .method="kPCA")

df&lt;-tibble(cbind(kpcaout@data@meta,kpcaout@data@data)) # Convert back to a dataframe

ggplot(df,aes(x=kPCA1,y=kPCA2,label=`Country Code`))+geom_text(size=2) #Plot
```

---

# Kernel PCA

&lt;img src="04KPCA_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# With different tuning parameter


```r
kpcaout &lt;- embed(.data = wb, .method="kPCA",kpar=list(sigma=0.001))
```

&lt;img src="04KPCA_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# With different kernel

```

# Image example

- Read in png files of images of the letter 'A' rotated and rescaled.
--

- There are 124848 variables.
--

- Only 10898 of these variable have any variation across the images.
--

- Lesson: Don't try a complicated dimension reduction technique when a simple one is better.
--

- For these variables run PCA and kPCA.

---

# Conclusion

- Kernel PCA has the advantage of being a non-linear dimension reduction technique.
--

- Some disadvantages include:
--

  + Need to choose a kernel.
  + Need to choose tuning parameters for the kernel.
  + Eigendecomposition is slow for large `\(n\)`, although this can be mitigated by using a kernel that imposes sparsity.
