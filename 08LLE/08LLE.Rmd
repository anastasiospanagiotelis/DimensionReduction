# Local Geometry

---

#Idea

- A smooth manifold may be locally flat (at least approximately).
--

- Each point can be approximated by a weighted affine combination of its neighbours.
--

- These weights "capture" the local geometry around that point.
--

- Aim is for points in the output space to have the same local geometry (as measured by weights)

# A mathematician'view

- Each point $\bx_i$ is estimated as a linear combination of neighbours
--

$$\bx_i\approx\sum\limits_{j\in \mathcal{N}_i} w_{ij}\bx_j$$
--

where $\mathcal{N}_i$ is set of nearest neighbours of $\bx_i$
--

- Subject to constraint $\sum\limits_{j\in \mathcal{N}_i} w_{ij}=1$ 
--

- This is known as an **affine** combination.

---

#Closed form solution

- For each $i$, minimise

$$||\bx_i-\sum\limits_{j\in \mathcal{N}_i} w_{ij}\bx_j||_2^2$$

-  Letting $\bC$ be covariance matrix of local points around $\bx_i$ then solution is

$$\bw_j=\frac{\sum\limits_k \bC^{-1}_{jk}}{\sum\limits_{k}\sum\limits_{l}\bC^{-1}_{jk}}$$

# Example

---

# Why an affine combination?

- Local geometry should be invariant to
--

  + Rotation
  + Scaling
  + Translation
--

- The sum to 1 constraint is needed to satisfy the third of these.
